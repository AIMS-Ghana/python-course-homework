print("hello world!")

# Carl's key notes: the "shebang", #!/... line tells the terminal what to use
#  to run the code
# After that, the `print(...)` function is the simplest way to produce stdout text.
# This particular task is THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO when learning a new
#  language or returning to an old one after a long break
# Last note: to be able to run the program directly (instead of having to invoke
#   python explicitly), you will need to make it executable: `chmod +x hw.py`
